# What did we discover about the tracking accuracy of GPS devices?

The motivation for this piece of work was to discover whether there is any significant difference in the ability of GPS devices to acccurately track a planned route. The devices include popular dedicated GPS devices from Garmin and Lezyne, several Android phones, and two home-built GPS devices. 

## The devices

### Garmin Edge 605
Introduced in 2008, this item purchased in 2010, it was marketed as a 'cycle computer', i.e. targetted more at sport cyclists, though the 605 lacks the ANT+ sensors of the more popular 705 (for heart rate, power, cadence tracking, etc). It's powered by an internal rechargeable lithium ion battery. Garmin does not reveal the GPS chipset used within the device. The interval between recorded track points can be configured to be every second, or "smart recording", which focuses more points in areas where speed or direction are changing. For this experiment the device was set to record every second.

### Garmin eTrex 30x
Introduced in 2015, it's marketed as an 'outdoor handheld', the focus being on a rugged and water-resistant device for a variety of sports and lesiure activities (cycling, walking, sailing, etc). It's powered by removable AA batteries. Garmin does not reveal the GPS chipset used within the device. The interval between recorded trackpoints can be configured to be a fixed time or distance, or set to 'auto'. For this experiment the device was set to 'auto' with the hint of'more often'. This resulted in a recorded track point on average every 6 seconds.

## Lezyne MegaXL
